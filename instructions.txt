The main objectives of this lab include:

    Design a simplified Art Gallery management system (We will do this step together in Week 8.)
        identify the relevant types of real-world entities;
        for each entity type, identify the list of relevant attributes and the list of data operations (or methods/functions)
        for each attribute, identify its suitable datatype
        for each method, describe its algorithm 
    Implement the above system in C++ using
        C++ classes with separate files
        use a few common functions such as std::sort() and std:count_if() included in the <algorithm> library
        learn to pass a free-standing function to the above functions as a parameter or use a lambda function if you feel courageous 

We are going to use this online Art Gallery to learn about the major types of relevant data. (Disclaimer: I am not associated with this website in any manner. I did a simple Web search and identified this one because of its very intuitive UI.)

Here's the instructor's design doc. You will need to

    write pesudocode for three member functions in the Gallery class and include your pseudocode in the DesignDoc
    implement all the included classes' member functions .
    include unit tests to test your C++ implementation of major member functions.
